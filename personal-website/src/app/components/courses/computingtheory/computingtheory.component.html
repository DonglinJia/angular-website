    <li>This course is about the theory of computation, which deals with mathematical properties of abstract models of computation and the problems they solve</li>
    <li>We can, for example, think about each program written in a particular programming language as a single element in the set of all programs written in hat languages,
    and we can investigate not only those programs that might be interesting to us, but also properties that must hold for all programs. </li>
    <li>We can also consider problems that some computational models can solve and that others cannot.</li>
